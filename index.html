          Indigenous crypto currency refers to a digital currency that is
          created and used by Indigenous<br />
          communities around the world. These currencies are often based on

        <h3>Crypto currencies?</h3>
        <p>
          Crypto currency, also known as digital currency, is a type of currency
          that exists only in digital form and uses cryptography to secure and
          verify transactions. It operates independently of a central bank or
          government and is based on decentralized technology called
          blockchain.<br />
          Crypto currencies use a peer-to-peer network to facilitate
          transactions between users directly without the need for
          intermediaries like banks. This means that transactions can be
          processed more quickly and at lower fees compared to traditional
          banking systems.
